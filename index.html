  		<p>
  			Numcheckers is a game based on checkers.
Checkers is a group of strategy Board games for two players that include diagonal moves of single pieces of the game and mandatory captures by jumping over enemy pieces. Draughts developed from alquerque. The name comes from the verb to draw or to move. In my numcheckers game, the same color shapes but different values. In addition, here you can combine two figures into one, resulting in one figure with a face value equal to the sum of the values of the related figures. The most popular forms are English checkers, also called American checkers, which are played on an 8×8 chessboard; Russian checkers, also played on an 8×8, and international checkers, played on a 10×10 Board. There are many other options that play on 8×8 boards. Canadian checkers and Singapore / Malaysian checkers (also known as dum) are played on a 12×12 Board. The numcheckers were played on an 8x8 Board. Checkers are played by two opponents on opposite sides of the playing field. One player has dark pieces, the other light. But in my game there are green and red pieces with different denominations with a value from 1 to 10 initially. But for one there is only one chance to combine several pieces. Players alternate turns. The player cannot move the opponent's piece. A step consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If a nearby square contains an opponent's piece, and the Square immediately behind it is vacant, the piece can be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it. Only the dark squares of the checkered Board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an empty square. Capturing is mandatory in most official rules, although some rules variations make capturing optional when presented. In almost all variants, a player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to blocking, loses the game. Uncrowned pieces move one step diagonally forward and capture the opponent's piece by moving two consecutive steps in the same line, jumping over the figure in the first step. Several enemy units can be captured in one move, provided that this is done by successive jumps made by one unit; jumps should not be in the same line and can "zigzag" (change the diagonal direction). In international checkers, kings (also called flying kings) move any distance on unlocked diagonals and can capture an opponent at any distance by jumping on any of the unoccupied squares immediately behind him. In my numcheckers game, the same rules apply.
