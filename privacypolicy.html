			<ul>
				<li>
					Coarse (such as city-level) geo-targeting based on current location;
				</li>
				<li>
					Content on the current site;
				</li>
			</ul>

				For all other users, personalized ads may be displayed. Personalized ads may use the following information:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Sites or apps that have been visited in the past;
				</li>
				<li>
					Past searches and location data;	
				</li>
